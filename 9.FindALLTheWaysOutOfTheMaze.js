// Use the above maze and modify your solution so it finds All the possible exits 
// through the Maze. To find all possible exit through the maze, think about how many 
// places you can move at each turn. Possibly up, down, left or right?

// Notice that this maze has 3 exits. Your recursive function should print all 
// three of the paths with the proper directions. For example, given the maze 
// above, the program should output the following:

// Path to the exit: RRDDLLDDRRRRRR
// Path to the exit: RRDDRRUURRDDDD
// Path to the exit: RRDDRRRRDD
